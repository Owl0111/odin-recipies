    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These frico pickle rollups will be your new favorite snack. Crushed Cheetos, crispy melted cheese, and dill
        spears come together for a craveable, crunchy, salty flavor bomb. Sharp Cheddar and vinegary pickles are a great
        pairing, though you can use your choice of cheese. Customize this fun party appetizer with different chips as
        well, and serve with ranch to dip.</p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
        <li>Heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Remove from heat and spray with cooking spray. Place over
            medium heat; spoon 1 tablespoon crushed Cheetos into an area approximately the same size as a cheese slice.
        </li>
        <li>Place one cheese slice on top of crushed Cheetos, and cook until cheese is melted and lightly browned around
            the edges, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place a pickle spear in the middle of the cheese slice, then gently fold the edges of the cheese around the
            pickle. </li>
        <li>Remove from the skillet and place on a wire rack or paper towel-lined plate. </li>
        <li>Repeat with remaining crushed Cheetos, cheese slices, and pickle spears, wiping out the skillet and spraying
            with cooking spray between batches. </li>
    </ol>
